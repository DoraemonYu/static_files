# About
Hello, pleased to meet you.  
This repository is used to host static files for my repositories and my personal websites.  
With CDN support from jsDelivr, static files could be loaded more faster and save my resources of website server.  
( BTW, here, I wanna thank github and jsDelivr. )  
 
If you are interested in it, you can google by yourself with the keywords about ***github + jsDelivr + CDN***  
 
 
Since I just use it to host static files, therefore, in this repository, there maybe nothing more valuable for you.  
However, you can visit my other repositorys  [https://doraemonyu.github.io]  I hope you could enjoy them, thanks and have a good day :)
